Explanation of Multi-Chaotic AES Encryption and Decryption Script

This script performs file encryption and decryption using a modified AES algorithm that incorporates
multi-chaotic systems (Lorenz and Chen attractors) to enhance security.
The key expansion process in this algorithm introduces a higher level of complexity and
unpredictability compared to the standard AES, making it more resistant to cryptographic attacks.

Components of the Script:

Lorenz Attractor Step:

This function computes the next step of the Lorenz attractor, which generates chaotic values
based on three parameters: sigma, rho, and beta. These values are updated iteratively to
create a complex and unpredictable sequence.
Chen Attractor Step:

Similar to the Lorenz attractor, this function computes the next step of the Chen attractor
using parameters alpha, beta, and delta. The Chen attractor adds another layer of chaos to
the key expansion process.
Multi-Chaotic Key Expansion:

This function combines the outputs of the Lorenz and Chen attractors over a specified number of
rounds to generate a key stream. The key stream is used to modify the AES key material,
making it more complex and harder to predict.
Multi-Chaotic AES Encrypt:

This function encrypts the input data using the AES algorithm, with the key material
modified by the multi-chaotic key expansion process. The resulting ciphertext is a combination
of the encrypted data and the nonce used by the AES cipher.
Multi-Chaotic AES Decrypt:

This function decrypts the ciphertext using the AES algorithm and the same multi-chaotic key
expansion process. It retrieves the original plaintext data from the encrypted file.
Generate Key:

This function generates a simple 3-byte key, which serves as the initial values for
the Lorenz and Chen attractors.
Save and Load File:

These functions handle the saving and loading of binary files. They are used to store
the encrypted and decrypted data.
Main Function:

The main function ties everything together. It accepts user input for the file path,
loads the file data, generates a key, performs encryption using the multi-chaotic AES method,
saves the encrypted file, decrypts the encrypted data, and saves the decrypted file.
Process Overview:

Initialization:

Set the number of rounds and parameters for the Lorenz and Chen attractors.
Initialize the attractor variables with the generated key.
Key Expansion:

Iterate over the number of rounds, updating the attractor variables using their respective step functions.
Generate a key stream by combining the chaotic values from both attractors.
Encryption:

Encrypt the input data using the AES algorithm with the modified key material.
Save the encrypted data to a file.
Decryption:

Decrypt the encrypted data using the same key expansion process.
Save the decrypted data to a file.
