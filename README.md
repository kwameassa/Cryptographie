 Cryptographic Project README

## Project Name: Enhancing the Performance of Cryptographic Algorithms for Secured Data Transmission

This repository contains code for a cryptographic project aimed at fulfilling the requirements of a PhD. The project consists of 8 modules, each addressing various aspects of cryptography and encryption techniques.

### Modules Overview:

1. **Comparative Analysis of Symmetric Algorithms** (`comparative_analysis.py`): This module performs a comparative analysis of various symmetric algorithms.

2. **AES Enhancement - Encoding and Shrinking Technique** (`aes_encoding_shrinking.py`): Implements an enhancement to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using encoding and shrinking techniques.

3. **AES Enhancement - LZMA-AES** (`lzma_aes.py`): Implements an enhancement to AES using LZMA compression.

4. **MultiCaotic Key Expansion** (`multicaotic_key_exp.py`): Explores a method for multi-caotic key expansion.

5. **Nth Root Mix Column Modification** (`mixcolumn_nth_root.py`): Modifies the Mix Column operation in AES using Nth roots.

6. **Secure Email with Hybrid RSA ECC** (`rsa_ecc_hybrid_secure_mail`): Implements a secure email system using hybrid RSA and ECC encryption.

7. **Hybridizing Northern Goshawk Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution (NGOA-DE) for Prime Number Generation in RSA** (`ngoa-de-rsa.py`): Combines Northern Goshawk Optimization Algorithm with Differential Evolution for prime number generation in RSA.

8. **Hybrid Cryptographic System for Cloud Security: Integrating Multi-Chaotic AES and Modified AES MixColumn with Optimized RSA Key Generation** (`rsa_ngoa_de_nth_root_aes`): Integrates Multi-Chaotic AES, Modified AES MixColumn, and optimized RSA key generation for cloud security.

**Frontend:** The project includes a frontend implemented in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
